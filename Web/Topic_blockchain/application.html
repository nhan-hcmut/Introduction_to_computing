                    <h4 id="anninh">1.Security</h4>

                    <p>Blockchains are nearly unhackable. Thanks to blockchain technology, each transaction is a "block", each block has the same role. Data is not centralized on any one server, cannot be deleted or is very difficult to change. With traditional information storage, if one server is hacked, the entire system will be paralyzed. To take down the entire blockchain network, hackers need to take down all "blocks" on the system at the same time. And this is impossible.</p>

Blockchain can improve the transparency and efficiency of finding out what food might be contaminated and where throughout the supply chain.

                        <i>Example:</i> Blockchain provides tangible proof of certifications and product claims through tags and audits. It allows for verification of certificates related to origin, environmental impact, and animal welfare, building trust with consumers. The use of blockchain in the dairy industry fosters greater trust in products, leading to increased demand. By improving product quality, safety regulation, and connecting farmers and consumers through a decentralized platform, blockchain is driving the next technological revolution.

                  <p>

Easily track the origin of the training institution or the learning process of the candidates from low to high.</p>
                  <p>Holberton School of software engineering in San Francisco established a project-based alternative to college. In October 2015, the school announced plans to share academic certificates on blockchain from 2017. “For employers, it avoids having them to spend valuable time checking candidates’ educational credentials by having to call universities or to pay a third party to do the job,” Sylvain Kalache, co-founder at Holberton School, told CNBC via email.</p>
